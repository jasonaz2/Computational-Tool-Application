# Computational-Tool-Application
Using python, a computational tool used to determine and display data of the Effect of pH in Rainwater due to greenhouse gases over a range of years. 

This project required extensive knowledge of python file input/output, matplotlib for data demonstration, error checking loops, and more. It uses predetermined mathematical functions, and methods such as binary interval chopping to generate necessary data for the plots, and the code alows for the saving and loading of files (limited capacity on the terminal code, unlimited capacity on the graphical user interface application) 

I initially produced the program to be used within a terminal, but I decided it would be more realistic as a tool to be used to have a graphical user interface. Both the terminal code and the GUI application are availble. 

The tkinter library was heavily utilized for the creation of the GUI Application, it enabled me to implement file editting/deletion, as well as an unlimited capacity for file saves, in addition to being a more user friendly software. 

For the most effective practice/use of these programs, allocate the file to an individual folder (each).
